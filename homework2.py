# Questions (Answer these in the homework2.py file as comments):

# 1) What’s the difference between Git, GitHub, and Git Bash?
#Git is the Software/Engine: It's a tool that lives on your Mac (or PC) and tracks the history of your files.
#GitHub is the Website/Cloud: It’s the online home for your Git projects. It allows you to share your code with instructors or teammates.
#Git Bash is the Interface (mostly for Windows): It’s an application that gives Windows users a terminal that acts like a Mac/Linux terminal

# 2) What’s the difference between the terminal and the command line?
#Command Line: The actual interface where you type text commands to the computer.
#Terminal: The "wrapper" or window app (like the one you have open on your Mac) that lets you access the command line.

# 3) How does Windows PowerShell differ from Git Bash?
#PowerShell: A task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft.
#Git Bash: A window for Windows users that emulates a Unix/Linux environment.

# 4) What’s the difference between Anaconda, conda, and Python?
#Python: The actual programming language.
#Conda: A package and environment manager (the tool that installs things).
#Anaconda: A large distribution that includes Python, conda, and hundreds of pre-installed data science libraries.

# 5) What is VS Code? 
#Visual Studio Code is a powerful text editor (IDE) used for writing code. 

# 6) What is a Jupyter Notebook? How is it different from Jupyter Lab?
#Jupyter Notebook: A web-based document that contains live code, equations, and text.
#Jupyter Lab: The newer, more advanced interface that allows you to open multiple Notebooks, terminals, and files in one window.

# 7) What does ~/ mean?
#It is a shortcut for your Home directory.

# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
#Absolute Path: The full address from the very root of the computer.
#Relative Path: The address relative to where you are standing right now.

# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
#Absolute: /Users/avaarreola/python_decal_fa25/course_assignments/homework2
#Relative: ../course_assignments/homework2

# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
#cd ..

# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
#It would attempt to delete or remove everything in your current directory. 

# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add: Prepares (stages) your changes to be saved.
# git commit: Takes a "snapshot" of your staged changes with a message.
# git push: Uploads your local snapshots to a remote server like GitHub.

# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?
#"git add ." stages every change in the current folder and "git add <file>" only stages that one specific file.

# 14) What do "git status" and "git log -1" do?
#"git status" shows you what files are changed and what is staged for commit. "git log -1" shows you the details of the most recent commit you made.

# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?
#Cloning: Downloading a repository for the first time.
#Pulling: Updating an existing repository with new changes from the server.

# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?
#The most frustrating part is typos and remembering the acronyms we have like mkdir but I can easily look it up in the lecture slides or online.

# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?
#A question I have is how do you make a website with python with graphics and what no. It seems foreign to me since its all code.

# 18) Tell me a fun fact!
#Over winter break I got a pit bull puppy named "Aria" and she is the cutest thing I have ever seen.

# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far. 
# (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)
print(2 ** 3) # This calculates 2 to the power of 3, which is 8
